# AI-powered Virtual Development Pod

## Overview

The **AI-powered Virtual Development Pod** simulates a complete software project lifecycle by orchestrating a team of AI agents. These agents assume specific roles—such as Business Analyst, Design, Developer, Testing, Security Analyst, and Performance Agent—to generate project artifacts from high-level business requirements. The system uses the Gemini API for text generation and CrewAI for managing agent interactions, all integrated with a user-friendly Streamlit interface.

This project is designed to:
- Generate detailed user stories from high-level business requirements.
- Produce comprehensive software design artifacts and diagrams.
- Create production-quality source code.
- Generate and execute test cases with definitive test results.
- Analyze security vulnerabilities and provide robust recommendations.
- Optimize performance by identifying bottlenecks and suggesting improvements.

## Features

- **Multi-Agent Workflow:**  
  Orchestrates a team of AI agents, each handling a distinct aspect of the project lifecycle.
- **Conversational UI:**  
  A Streamlit interface that allows the Project Manager to view master outputs and chat with individual agents.
- **Definitive, Sure-Shot Responses:**  
  All agents generate responses that are clear, complete, and free of placeholders or uncertainty.
- **Integrated Environment:**  
  All configurations are managed via environment variables, ensuring seamless integration and deployment

```

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd ai_virtual_dev_pod
   ```

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   # On Windows:
   venv\Scripts\activate
   # On macOS/Linux:
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   Ensure you have the required dependencies by running:
   
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Environment Setup

Create a **.env** file in the root of your project with the following content (replace placeholder values as needed):

```dotenv
# .env file for AI-powered virtual development pod project

# Gemini API Configuration
GEMINI_API_KEY=
GEMINI_API_MODEL=

# Pinecone API Configuration for RAG (if applicable)
PINECONE_API_KEY=
PINECONE_INDEX_NAME=
PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT=

# (Optional) CrewAI and Langchain Configuration
# CREWAI_API_KEY=
# LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=
```

## Running the Application

To launch the application using Streamlit, run the following command from your project root:

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

This will start the Streamlit server and open your browser to view the Project Manager dashboard, where you can run the project workflow and interact with the agents.

## Testing

Run the unit tests to ensure all components are functioning correctly:

```bash
python -m unittest discover tests
```

## Project Workflow

1. **Input Business Requirements:**  
   Enter high-level business requirements in the Streamlit UI.

2. **Master Workflow Execution:**  
   The system orchestrates the agents to generate:
   - Detailed user stories (Business Analyst Agent)
   - Software design artifacts (Design Agent)
   - Production-quality source code (Developer Agent)
   - Comprehensive test cases and execution results (Testing Agent)
   - Security analysis report (Security Analyst Agent)
   - Performance optimization report (Performance Agent)

3. **Agent Conversation:**  
   The Project Manager can interact with individual agents via the chat interface to get more detailed, definitive updates on their specific artifacts.

# AI-powered Virtual Development Pod — Version 1

## Overview

The **AI-powered Virtual Development Pod** is an end-to-end, multi-agent software development automation platform. It simulates a real-world software project lifecycle by orchestrating specialized AI agents—Business Analyst, Designer, Developer, Tester, Security Analyst, and Performance Optimizer. Each agent autonomously generates and validates project artifacts, from user stories to code, tests, and optimization reports, all coordinated through a modern Streamlit UI.

---

## Features

- **Multi-Agent Orchestration:**  
  Automated workflow where each agent (Business Analyst, Design, Developer, Testing, Security Analyst, Performance Optimizer) generates and validates its respective artifact.

- **Conversational Project Manager UI:**  
  Streamlit dashboard for running the full workflow and chatting with individual agents for detailed, definitive updates.

- **Artifact Generation:**  
  - **User Stories:** Structured, actionable user stories from high-level business requirements.
  - **Design Artifacts:** System architecture, component breakdowns, and design diagrams.
  - **Source Code:** Production-quality, well-commented code following best practices.
  - **Test Cases & Results:** Comprehensive test cases and clear test execution summaries.
  - **Security Analysis:** Vulnerability reports and actionable security recommendations.
  - **Performance Optimization:** Bottleneck identification and optimization suggestions.

- **Definitive, Sure-Shot Responses:**  
  All agent outputs are clear, complete, and free of placeholders or uncertainty.

- **Gemini API Integration:**  
  Uses Google Gemini for all generative tasks.

- **CrewAI Integration:**  
  (Stubbed) for agent communication and orchestration.

- **Configurable & Extensible:**  
  Modular codebase with environment-based configuration and easy extensibility for new agents or integrations.

- **Unit Tested:**  
  Includes comprehensive unit tests for agents, services, and the Streamlit UI.

## Running the Application

Launch the Streamlit UI:
```sh
streamlit run main.py
```
This opens the Project Manager dashboard in your browser.

---

## Testing

Run all unit tests:
```sh
python -m unittest discover tests
```

---

## Usage

1. **Enter Business Requirements:**  
   Use the Streamlit UI to input high-level requirements.

2. **Run Project Workflow:**  
   The orchestrator coordinates all agents to generate user stories, design, code, tests, security, and performance reports.

3. **Review & Interact:**  
   View all generated artifacts and chat with any agent for further clarification or updates.

---

## Configuration

- All API keys and settings are managed via the `.env` file.
- Templates for artifacts are in `data/artifacts_templates/`.
